## About

I'm a 23 year old student at MATC.
I was born and raised here in Milwaukee, WI. 
I am a Wisconsin sports fanatic, I love to collect Pokemon cards, 
and I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering. 
Some of my other hobbies and passions include photography, video gaming, 
and music production with influences such as Lofi Hip hop 
and various sub-genres of Vaporwave.
I enjoy studying and working 
in software development fields because I believe the potential
to create is unbounded. A goal of mine would be to 
begin the creation of my very own 
video game. I'd like to develop 
this game throughout a span of decades to 
create something truly intricate and special.
